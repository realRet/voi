Terros is the second boss we will be killing. Terros is a stationary boss in the center of the room, the room gets smaller as we play every 90 seconds the boss will cast Resonating Anniliation which will remove 1/4th of the room after 4 cast we wipe.

## Rockblast
The second mechanic we have to deal with is Rockblast and Awakened Earth. Rockblast is a simple soak. after the ability has been soaked a few marked players will get the Awakened Earth which will create a stone pillar that needs to be destroyed. To do this players should drop the debuff in groups of 4 so we can easily get rid of them

As the fight progresses more of players will be targeted by awakened earth so it will look like this

## Shatering impact
Shattering impact is a mechanic that needs to be dodge, nothing special
