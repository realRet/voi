This boss is the third boss we will take on. The primal council is not super complex it's like a game of rock paper scissors, but instead it's earth, fire, frost and lightning. Where Earth defeats lightning, fire defeats earth and frost defeats fire. I'll go into all mechanics in depth and then come back to elaborate on this analogy. 

## Earthen pillar | Opalfang 
[Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=370991/earthen-pillar) spawn on targeted players doing some damage. After this there are some semi permanent pillars around the room. These pillars can be destroyed by [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=374038/meteor-axes) creating Â [Embar Firepath](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/npc=187767/embar-firepath) and also be used to safely remove the [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=391686/conductive-mark) 

## Scorched Ground | Ember Firepath
[Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371514/scorched-ground) is created by destroying [Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=370991/earthen-pillar) with [Meteor Axes](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=374038/meteor-axes). This pool of lava can be used to remove stacks of [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371836/primal-blizzard) removing stacks cools of the lava and will eventually remove the pool of the floor ## Primal Blizzard | Kadros Kadros will channel a storm for 10 seconds, this storm gives players the [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371836/primal-blizzard) debuff which increases frost damage taken. These stacks can and should be removed, we will do this around 5 stacks, by standing in [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371514/scorched-ground) 
## Conductive Mark | Dathea Stormlash 
Dathea randomly applies [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=391686/conductive-mark) this mechanic will deal increasing damage over 20 seconds. Whenever you walk in a range of 5 yards of another player, the debuff will spread. It can be safely removed by standing close to an earthen pillar [Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=370991/earthen-pillar). There is a second ability the boss cast which is [Chain Lightning](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=372275/chain-lightning) there is no way to get rid of this ability other than spreading out.

To come back to the example on top, when you are targeted with [Conductive Mark](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=391686/conductive-mark) you can move to an [Earthen Pillar](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=370991/earthen-pillar) and safely get rid of the dubuff, thus defeating "lightning with earth".  The same can be said for [Primal Blizzard](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371836/primal-blizzard) where you can stand in the fire from [Scorched Ground](https://www.wowhead.com/beta/spell=371514/scorched-ground) to remove this debuff
